Fully on‚Äëchain verifier demo on Solana L1 (CPI‚Äëfriendly):
ZK-STARK (Winterfell 0.12) + SLH‚ÄëDSA (SPHINCS+, NIST FIPS 205) signature + ML‚ÄëKEM/Kyber (NIST FIPS 203) KEM.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What it does
- On‚Äëchain verification:  
  - STARK (Winterfell 0.12) for a minimal affine‚Äëcounter AIR  
  - SLH‚ÄëDSA (SPHINCS+, NIST FIPS 205) signature verification (SHA2‚Äë128s)
- Full message persisted on chain as a single account: cipher + ML‚ÄëKEM/Kyber (NIST FIPS 203) ciphertext + STARK proof + metadata
- Chunked uploads with hash chaining to control DoS and fees
- Custom heap allocator and CU tuning for SBF (Solana BPF)

Devnet program id (Anchor): `CECNRbDxFQVfWiQwvG8qcSGPGSk8eLWraBCERcdL5DKT`

## üåç Why this matters
Pairing‚Äëbased SNARKs rely on hardness assumptions (e.g., discrete logs) that are theoretically vulnerable to Shor‚Äôs algorithm on a sufficiently capable quantum computer.  
This PoC demonstrates a fully on‚Äëchain alternative using a hash‚Äëbased STARK, SLH‚ÄëDSA (SPHINCS+, NIST FIPS 205), and ML‚ÄëKEM/Kyber (NIST FIPS 203).

## üìÇ Layout
- programs/stark-pqc-verifier ‚Äî L1 verifier program (CPI-friendly)  
- examples/cli-chat ‚Äî end-to-end demo: encrypt, prove, sign, upload, finalize, receive  
- examples/benchmarks ‚Äî scripts & logs to measure compute unit (CU) usage  
- crates/stark-prover ‚Äî local STARK prover (Winterfell 0.12)  
- crates/slh-dsa-wasm ‚Äî SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+, NIST FIPS 205) bindings for Node/TS via wasm-pack  
- crates/kem-cli ‚Äî ML-KEM/Kyber768 helper used by the demo  
- .github/workflows/ci.yml ‚Äî CI workflow: builds the program (`anchor build`) and client-side artifacts on each push/PR;  
  skips steps that depend on devnet (deployments/transactions/benchmarks)
- fixed/ ‚Äî pinned IDL/types for running without local Anchor build  
- third-party/* ‚Äî vendored dependencies (patched for Solana BPF)  
- Other infra files: Anchor.toml, .cargo/config.toml, etc.

## üöÄ Quick start
Default: run without Anchor build/deploy using the pinned IDL/types under fixed/.  
Prereqs (tested with): Rust 1.88.0, Cargo 1.88.0, Solana CLI 2.2.20 (Agave), Node.js v24.4.0, npm 11.4.2, wasm‚Äëpack 0.13.1
> **Note:** Tested on Linux, macOS, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2).  
> Native Windows without WSL is not supported by solana-cli and may not work.

0. **Install dependencies**

Before running the demo, install the Node.js packages for the CLI example:  
```
npm --prefix examples/cli-chat install (or ~/solana-pqzk-fullchain/examples/cli-chat$ npm install)
```

1. **Connect to devnet & fund your wallet**
```
solana config set --url devnet
solana-keygen new (if you don't have wallet)
solana airdrop 2
```
Wallet locations used by this repo  
Anchor uses the wallet in Anchor.toml:  
[provider] wallet = "~/.config/solana/id.json" (default in this repo)  
Client SDK (examples/cli-chat/src/utils/sdk.ts) resolves the wallet in this order:  
ANCHOR_WALLET ‚Üí SOLANA_KEYPAIR ‚Üí ~/.config/solana/id.json (default)

2. **Run the pinned devnet demo (no build/deploy needed)**
```
npm --prefix examples/cli-chat run setup (or ~/solana-pqzk-fullchain/examples/cli-chat$ npm run setup)
npm --prefix examples/cli-chat run keys (or ~/solana-pqzk-fullchain/examples/cli-chat$ npm run keys)
npm --prefix examples/cli-chat run upload (or ~/solana-pqzk-fullchain/examples/cli-chat$ npm run upload)
npm --prefix examples/cli-chat run finalize (or ~/solana-pqzk-fullchain/examples/cli-chat$ npm run finalize)
npm --prefix examples/cli-chat run receive (or ~/solana-pqzk-fullchain/examples/cli-chat$ npm run receive)
```
Notes:
- The SDK reads fixed/idl/stark_pqc_verifier.json and fixed/types/stark_pqc_verifier.ts by default.
- The devnet program id is taken from the IDL‚Äôs metadata.address.
- The commands above still build client-side crates during npm run setup.

**To use your own deployment (Optional):**
```
anchor build
anchor deploy
```
Set your deployed ID in program code:  
programs/stark-pqc-verifier/src/lib.rs ‚Üí declare_id!("YOUR_PROGRAM_ID");  
Set it in Anchor config:  
Anchor.toml ‚Üí [programs.devnet].stark_pqc_verifier = "YOUR_PROGRAM_ID"

Then edit examples/cli-chat/src/utils/sdk.ts to point to target/ instead of fixed/:

import type { StarkPqcVerifier } from '../../../../target/types/stark_pqc_verifier.ts';  
const idlPath = resolve(__dirname, '../../../../target/idl/stark_pqc_verifier.json');  
Ensure target/idl/stark_pqc_verifier.json contains your deployed program id in metadata.address.

## üìù Design notes
Public inputs for the AIR are derived on chain from SHA256(cipher) to bind the proof to the ciphertext.
SLH‚ÄëDSA verification signs cipher || kem || nonce || slot_le.  
Buffers are uploaded in ‚â§ 900‚Äëbyte chunks with running SHA‚Äë256 to ensure integrity.  
A small custom allocator avoids writable ELF sections; clients provide a heap frame matching the on‚Äëchain limit.

### Advanced (optional): Hashers & FRI
- Hasher
  - Default: Sha2_256 (uses Solana hashv; good CU).
  - Tested: Blake3_256 (software on BPF). Reliable at ~64‚Äëbit security; ~128‚Äëbit typically exceeds CU and fails.
  - Proofs are hasher‚Äëspecific (not interchangeable).

- Security / FRI
  - Prover: tune ProofOptions (queries / blowup / grinding).
  - Verifier: set AcceptableOptions::MinConjecturedSecurity(N) to match the target (N ‚â§ 127; 127 is the cap).
  - For Blake3 experiments, start with N = 64.

If you change hasher or security, regenerate the proof and re‚Äëupload.
